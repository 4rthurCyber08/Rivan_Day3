## ðŸŽ¯ Review

### 1. What is the reason for the error?

~~~
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 1/0/1
Router(config-if)# ip add 192.168.16.143 255.255.255.240
Bad Mask /28 for address 192.168.16.143
~~~

&nbsp;
---
&nbsp;

### 2. Devices fail to obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server. Determine the issue by going through the dhcp configurations shown below.

~~~
Router# show run | s dhcp
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.28.0.1 10.28.0.100
ip dhcp pool mainpool
 network 10.28.0.0 255.255.255.248
 default-router 10.28.0.1 
 domain-name main.com
 dns-server 10.28.1.10
~~~

### 5. Which goal is achieved by the implementation of private IPv4 addressing on a network?
  - [ ] __A.__ provides an added level of protection against Internet exposure
  - [ ] __B.__ provides a reduction in size of the forwarding table on network routers

&nbsp;

### 6. Which two options are the best reasons to use an IPV4 private IP space? (Choose two.)
  - [ ] __A.__ to enable intra-enterprise communication
  - [ ] __B.__ to implement NAT

## Switching vs Routing
Switching - forwards data based on L2 information (MAC Address)
- Linux: arp -v
- Windows: arp -a
- Cisco: show arp

Terms:
- ARP
- ARP Request
- ARP Reply
- Unknown Unicast
- Known Unicast
- L2 Forward Operations (Unchanged MAC)
- L3 Forward Operations (Change MAC)

Routing - forwards data based on L3 information (IP Address)
- Linux: netstat -rn
- Windows: route print
- Cisco: show ip interface brief
