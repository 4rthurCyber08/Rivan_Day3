## â›… Warm Up for Day 3.

<br>

### ðŸ”§ Configure the following:
  - Switch (__CoreTAAS__ & __CoreBABA__)
  - Voice Gateway/Call Manager (__CUCM - Cisco Unified Call Manager__)
  - Router (__EDGE__)

<br>

## ðŸŽ¯ Review

### 1. What is the reason for the error?

~~~
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 1/0/1
Router(config-if)# ip add 192.168.16.143 255.255.255.240
Bad Mask /28 for address 192.168.16.143
~~~

### 2. Devices fail to obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server. Determine the issue by going through the dhcp configurations shown below.

~~~
Router# show run | s dhcp
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.28.0.1 10.28.0.100
ip dhcp pool mainpool
 network 10.28.0.0 255.255.255.248
 default-router 10.28.0.1 
 domain-name main.com
 dns-server 10.28.1.10
~~~

### 3. Match the Host addresses on the left to their correct IP range on the right.

|     | Host                |         ---        |     | Range (1st Valid - Broadcast)     |
| --- | ---                 | ---                | --- | ---                               |
| 1   | 10.187.45.21 /14    |                    | A   | 192.168.100.193 - 192.168.100.223 |
| 2   | 10.180.201.90 /12   |                    | B   | 10.176.0.1 - 10.191.255.255       |
| 3   | 172.16.74.5 /20     |                    | C   | 172.16.64.1 - 172.16.79.255       |
| 4   | 172.16.81.1 /19     |                    | D   | 192.168.100.193 - 192.168.100.208 |
| 5   | 192.168.100.203 /27 |                    | E   | 10.184.0.1 - 10.187.255.255       |
| 6   | 192.168.100.195 /28 |                    | F   | 172.16.64.1 - 172.16.95.255       |

### 5. Which goal is achieved by the implementation of private IPv4 addressing on a network?
  - [ ] __A.__ provides an added level of protection against Internet exposure
  - [ ] __B.__ provides a reduction in size of the forwarding table on network routers
  - [ ] __C.__ allows communication across the Internet to other private networks
  - [ ] __D.__ allows servers and workstations to communicate across public network boundaries

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### 6. Which two options are the best reasons to use an IPV4 private IP space? (Choose two.)
  - [ ] __A.__ to enable intra-enterprise communication
  - [ ] __B.__ to implement NAT
  - [ ] __C.__ to connect applications
  - [ ] __D.__ to conserve global address space
  - [ ] __E.__ to manage routing overhead

### 8. Based on the diagram below, what command was entered on the device's Ethernet1/1 interface that registered the following entry to its routing table.
~~~
C        10.1.4.4/30 is directly connected, Ethernet1/1
L        10.1.4.6/32 is directly connected, Ethernet1/1
~~~
  - [ ] __A.__ `router(config-if)# ip address 10.1.4.4 255.255.255.252`
  - [ ] __B.__ `router(config-if)# ip address 10.1.4.4 255.255.255.255`
  - [ ] __C.__ `router(config-if)# ip address 10.1.4.6 255.255.255.252`
