Static routing

Why routing?

From R1, 
ping 10.1.1.2  vs  ping 10.1.1.5

Is the result normal?


Configure Static routes to make them ping:

Recipe:
ip route [Destination IP]  [Network/Host Mask]  [Interface / Nex-hop]

!@R1
conf t
 ip route 10.1.1.5 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.2
 end


Exercise 01: Configure a static route on R2 destined for R3's e1/2 interface.

!@R2
conf t
 ip route __.__.__.__  __.__.__.__  __.__.__.__
 end

Ans

!@R2
conf t
 ip route 10.1.1.9 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.6
 end

---

!@R1
conf t
 ip route 10.1.1.6 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.2
 end
 
Routing must be two way

!@R3
conf t
 ip route 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.5
 end
