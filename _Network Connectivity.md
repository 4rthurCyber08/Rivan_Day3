## Job Interview Questions for L1/L2 NOC-MSP postions.
### Interpret the components of a Routing Table.
A routing table is a database, also known as a FIB (Forwarding Information Base), used by network devices to determine the most efficient path for data packets as they travel across a network.
- Linux: `netstat -rn`
- Windows: `route print`
- Cisco: `show ip interface brief`

### üéØ Exercise 01: Review on DHCP & IP addressing.
What are the steps to configure DHCP?
1. Exclude IP addresses
2. Create DHCP pool
  - Network
  - Default-Router
  - Domain-Name
  - DNS-server

3. Assign DHCP clients

<br>

### DHCP Loadbalancing
~~~
!@D1
conf t
 ip dhcp excluded-address 10.2.1.1 10.2.1.100
 ip dhcp pool MGMTPOOL.COM
  network 10.2.1.0 255.255.255.0
  default-router 10.2.1.254
  domain-name MGMTPOOL.COM
  dns-server 10.2.1.133
  end
~~~

~~~
!@D2
conf t
 ip dhcp excluded-address 10.2.1.1 10.2.1.200
 ip dhcp pool MGMTPOOL.COM
  network 10.2.1.0 255.255.255.0
  default-router 10.2.1.254
  domain-name MGMTPOOL.COM
  dns-server 10.2.1.133
  end
~~~

### VLAN Assignment
Place PCs (P1, P2) on VLAN 10

~~~~
!@A1
conf t
 int e0/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
  end
~~~

~~~
!@A2
conf t
 int e1/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
  end
~~~

### DHCP Clients

Make P1 & P2 a DHCP client:

!@P1
conf t
 int e0/0
  no shut
  ip add dhcp
  end

!@P2
conf t
 int e1/0
  no shut
  ip add dhcp
  end


What IP addresses did P1 & P2 get?

!@P1 & P2
show ip int brief | ex una

Exercise 02: Configure S1 for VLAN 100, and manually set the IP address, 192.168.1.133 /27, on S1's e1/0 interface.
- Make sure S1 is able to ping D1, D2, A1, & A2 on VLAN 100.

!@S1
conf t



  end

!@D1
conf t



  end



Ans

!@S1
conf t
 int e1/0
  ip add 192.168.1.133 255.255.255.224
  no shut
  end

!@D1
conf t
 int e1/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 100
  end


Exercise 03: Configure S2 for VLAN 20, and manually set the IP address, 10.2.2.133 /24, on S2's e1/0 interface.
- Make sure S2 is able to ping D1 & D2 on VLAN 20.

!@S2
conf t



  end

!@D2
conf t



  end
  
  
  
Ans

!@S2
conf t
 int e1/0
  ip add 10.2.2.133 255.255.255.0
  no shut
  end
